List of issue and there solution -

ðŸ”¹ What I did

In your Body component, you wrote:

<RestaurantCard resData={resObj} />


Here, resObj is an array of restaurants (look at your resObj definition â€“ it has [ { type: 'restaurant', data: { â€¦ } } ]).

So resData inside RestaurantCard becomes the whole array, not a single object.

ðŸ”¹ What RestaurantCard expects

Inside RestaurantCard, you wrote:

<h3>{resData.data.name}</h3>


Here youâ€™re assuming that resData is a single object with a .data property.

But actually, since you passed the entire array, resData.data is undefined.

Thatâ€™s why React throws the error:

TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')

ðŸ”¹ Fix

You should pass a single object from the array, not the whole array.

âœ… For one card:

<RestaurantCard resData={resObj[0]} />


âœ… For multiple cards:

{resObj.map((restaurant) => (
  <RestaurantCard key={restaurant.data.id} resData={restaurant} />
))}

ðŸ”¹ In short

Problem: You passed an array where your component expected an object.

Solution: Pass a single object (resObj[0]) or loop over the array (map) to render multiple cards.


ðŸš¨ Issue in Swiggy API

You followed a tutorial where:

Restaurants were at json.data.cards[2]

Each restaurant used resData.data

But in the current Swiggy API:

Restaurants are at json.data.cards[4]

Each restaurant uses resData.info

deliveryTime is now inside sla.deliveryTime

Because of this mismatch â†’ your UI showed a blank screen.

âœ… Fix

Correct state setter â†’ used setListOfRestaurants (plural).

Correct JSON path â†’

json?.data?.cards[4]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants


Correct destructuring â†’

const { name, cuisines, avgRating, costForTwo, sla } = resData.info;
